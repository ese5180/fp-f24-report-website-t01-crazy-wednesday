    <p>Since frequent data updates are not required for the trash bin system, the device will <strong>operate for 30 minutes per day</strong> with updates occurring every 2 hours. The 30 minutes is because every time you turn on the Air quality sensor, it will run for at least 30 minutes and then turn off.</p>

    <p>All other components, including sensors and the MCU, will remain in sleep mode throughout the day, except during the 30 minutes of scheduled operation.</p>

<h2 id="2-key-successes-what-went-well-and-why">2 Key Successes: What Went Well and Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One of the key successes of our project was the successful integration of multiple complex technologies, including Nordic’s hardware platform, the Zephyr RTOS, LTE connectivity, nRF Cloud services, and Memfault for monitoring and debugging. This integration demonstrates our ability to effectively combine cutting-edge tools and frameworks into a cohesive and functional system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, we successfully built and deployed our code across different Windows operating systems, including Windows 10 and Windows 11, as well as under various system configurations. This ensures the portability and robustness of our development environment, making it adaptable for different users and setups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These accomplishments are significant because they highlight not only our technical expertise but also our attention to compatibility and usability. By ensuring the seamless integration of diverse components and achieving consistent builds across platforms, we have created a reliable and scalable foundation for further development and deployment of our system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-challenges-and-lessons-learned-what-didnt-go-well-and-why">3 Challenges and Lessons Learned: What Didn’t Go Well and Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Our project’s security implementations did not progress as intended, primarily due to time constraints, complexity, and a lack of dedicated expertise. While we initially aimed to encrypt data transmissions, verify signed firmware updates, and implement secure boot features, these measures were repeatedly deprioritized as we focused on foundational functionality and reliable system integration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advanced nature of embedded security, along with the learning curve involved, made it difficult to address these goals effectively within our limited timeframe. Consequently, many planned security enhancements remained incomplete or only partially realized by the end of the project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-optimizing-development-lessons-for-future-approaches-with-limited-time-and-resourcesa">4 Optimizing Development: Lessons for Future Approaches with Limited Time and Resourcesa</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If we had to do it again, we would make several adjustments to our development approach to maximize the use of finite time and resources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First，we would incorporate additional sensors to gather more comprehensive data for determining when garbage collection is necessary. For example, using weight sensors could provide valuable insights into the actual contents of the bin. Lightweight materials like cardboard may take up significant volume but have a lower priority for collection. By combining data from volume sensors with weight measurements, we could make more informed decisions and optimize waste collection routes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Second, we would consider using a more flexible cloud platform, such as AWS. While nRF Cloud provided a simple and efficient solution for our use case, its limitations in building customizable front-end applications restricted our ability to create a more advanced and interactive interface. Platforms like AWS offer modular components and greater flexibility, which could allow for more sophisticated data visualization and user interaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, we would allocate more resources to building a scalable and user-friendly front-end platform. With a more robust cloud service, we could deliver a better user experience, showcasing real-time data and analytics in a visually engaging manner.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These changes would enhance the functionality and scalability of the system, providing better decision-making tools and an improved overall user experience. However, they would need to be balanced carefully against time and budget constraints to ensure feasibility.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-refining-the-system-potential-design-changes-post-development">5 Refining the System: Potential Design Changes Post-Development</h2>

<h3 id="51-was-the-wireless-communication-protocol-the-correct-choice">5.1 Was the wireless communication protocol the correct choice?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, we believe cellular was the correct choice for our wireless communication protocol. Cellular connectivity ensures that our system can communicate reliably in nearly any location, which is critical for use cases where coverage is a priority. Unlike other wireless communication protocols such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, cellular networks provide broad geographic coverage without the need for additional infrastructure, making it ideal for applications like ours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this choice does come with trade-offs. One of the main challenges is the added cost of purchasing mobile data plans, which can increase operational expenses, especially as the system scales to more devices. Despite this, the benefits of ubiquitous connectivity outweigh the costs, as it ensures that the system remains functional in diverse environments, including remote or rural areas where other communication methods may be unavailable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="52-would-other-sensors-or-actuators-work-better">5.2 Would other sensors or actuators work better?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yes, other sensors could potentially work better for our system. For example, replacing the ultrasonic sensors with cameras could significantly improve the accuracy of identifying the garbage percentage in a bin. Cameras, combined with image recognition algorithms, can provide detailed insights into the type and volume of waste. This would enable the system to differentiate between various materials, such as cardboard, plastic, or organic waste, and calculate the bin’s fullness more precisely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While cameras would introduce additional complexity in terms of data processing and potentially higher power consumption, the increased accuracy and flexibility they offer could justify the trade-off. This approach could also open the door to future features, such as categorizing waste for recycling purposes or integrating advanced analytics for waste management optimization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overall, transitioning to camera-based sensors would enhance the system’s functionality and provide more actionable data for decision-making.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="53-did-the-target-market-want-something-different">5.3 Did the target market want something different?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Our target market appears to value the core functionality we provided, but there are areas where their needs might differ from our current implementation. For example, while our system focuses on measuring bin fullness and optimizing waste collection, some potential users expressed interest in additional features such as waste categorization for recycling, real-time notifications for bin maintenance, or predictive analytics to forecast when bins will be full based on historical data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, some users may prefer a solution with a more customizable and visually engaging interface, which could be better supported by using a more flexible cloud platform like AWS instead of nRF Cloud. This would allow us to provide tailored dashboards and integrations that align more closely with the specific needs of different customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, cost sensitivity might influence some customers’ decisions. They may want a system that minimizes ongoing operational costs, such as mobile data expenses, even if it means a trade-off in connectivity or functionality. Offering hybrid communication options or optimizing data usage could address this concern.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In future iterations, aligning more closely with these desires could enhance the appeal and adoption of our system within the target market.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
